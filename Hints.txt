The result can be false for three reasons:

-the JSON string has invalid syntax;
-the JSON string doesn’t represent an object;
-the StaticJsonBuffer is too small – use https://arduinojson.org/v6/assistant/ to compute the buffer size.

3) pins
On  Uno, don't use pin 0 or 1, and avoid pin 13. These are reserved to write a sketch
